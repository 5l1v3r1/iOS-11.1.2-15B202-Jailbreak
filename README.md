# iOS 11 Jailbreak
## Target
This jailbreak is for iOS 11.1.2 (15B202).  If you don't have this *exact* version it probably won't work for you
## Version
This is release 0.2a, there are updates planned for stability and expanding the device coverage
## Copyright
I could have copy-pasta'd MIT or BSD, but it boils down to this: credit the authors.  This jailbreak is released as 100% open-source to help the security community.  Feel free to take the code, use it how you wish, just keep in mind that if it's my code, attribute me BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY if I used someone else's code or ideas, make sure to credit them and *respect their licenses* (QiLin, especially). My goal is for this code to help the security community and vulnerability research in general, so don't use it commercially.  Let information be free!
